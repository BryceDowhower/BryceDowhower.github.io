            <div class="content">

                <p>In my Spring 2019 programming course, we were given the flexibility to choose our own project to do. I decided I wanted to create my version of the game Pong.</p>
                <p>My game has the option of single-player or two-player if you want to play with a friend. The sinlge player option pits you against a simple computer opponent that identifies where the ball is at and then moves a variable amount to try and intercept it.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, there are also several different themes users can chose from, each with their own style. I enjoyed doing this as it allowed me to express my creativity.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">Database Creation Project</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In my database course, throughout the course of the semester, myself and two groupmates worked to design a datavase from beginning to finish.</p>
                <p>We began with the conceptual design portion of our database. This involved designing an Entity Relationship Diagram as well as defining any assumptions we made.</p>
                <p>Next we moved onto logical design. In this portion of our project we worked to normalize our tables to reduce redundancy, eliminate data duplication, and ensure well-structured relations by making columns atomic. For our project, we used the third normal form of normalization. During this stage, we also ensured referential integrity, defining relationships between our associations. </p>
                <p>The final step of our project was physical design and implementation. Here is were we created a data dictionary and wrote out our create statements to create our tables and relationships between the tables. We also inserted in random data we generated through a website. After creating our database and entering data, we would enter some SQL select statements to ensure our database was working properly. </p>
                <p>This project was beneficial as we got first hand experience in all of the innerworkings of a database, and how tricky it can be if careful consideration is not taken for each relationship.</p>
