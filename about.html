                <p>When I made this site, I was a senior at the University of Oklahoma. I graduated December 2019 with my bachelors in Management Information Studies.</p>
                <p>I chose MIS because I like technology and learning about computer topics, however I also desired the human interactions that might follow a business degree.</p>
                <p>I chose the University of Oklahoma, because that was my desire since I was a child. I grew up watching Sooner football and both my parents were OU graduates. Therefore, I knew OU was the choice for me.</p>
